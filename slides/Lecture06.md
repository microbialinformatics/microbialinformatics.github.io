## Announcements
* Start thinking about your project for the first half of the semester
    * Emphasis on data analysis
    * Due 10/24/2104 (friday)
    * Feel free to come to office hours to discuss project ideas
    * I have some ideas for microbial ecology analysis projects
* When you upload your assignments, upload the README.Rmd and README.md files generated by RStudio/knitr

--- 

## Review
* Everything in R is some form of a vector
* Vectors
* List
* Matrix
* Table
* Data table
* Factors

---

## Learning objectives
* Appreciate the diversity of different data structures
* Understand how to calculate descriptive variables
* Begin to develop data visualization skills in R


---

## Factors
* Defining categorical variables
* In a genome we might think of the forward/reverse orientation, reading frame, dna/protein sequence designation, or annotation category as categorical variables.  	
* Create factors


```r
metadata <- read.table(file="wild.metadata.txt", header=T)
rownames(metadata) <- metadata$Group
metadata <- metadata[,-1]

factor(metadata$ET)
metadata$ET <-factor(metadata$ET)
summary(metadata)
levels(metadata$ET)
```

* What other variables here would be a factor?

---

##	Lists
* Similar to data fames, but not necessarily read across rows and not all variables have the same length
* Could hold a genome's data within a list:
 * name: Character with organism name
 * genome.size: Number with number of bases
 * start.pos: Vector of start positions for each gene
 * end.pos: Vector of end positions for each gene
 * gene.name: Name of each gene
 * hydrolases: Names of genes that are hydrolases
* Allow one to create complex data structures
* We'll use these only in passing

---

## An example of where we'll use lists...
* Let's get the mean weight for each sex of mouse

```r
aggregate(metadata$Weight, by=metadata$Sex, mean)
aggregate(metadata$Weight, by=list(metadata$Sex), mean)
sex.weight <- aggregate(metadata$Weight, by=list(metadata$Sex), mean)
sex.weight$x
```

* Let's get the mean weight for each sex and species of mouse

```r
aggregate(metadata$Weight, by=list(metadata$Sex, metadata$SP), mean)
```

---

## Descriptive data analysis

*	With large datasets it's easy to get lost and not know what the data look like
*	Need to devlop strategies to get a handle on the data
*	Three approaches:
  -	Visualize data tables
  -	Summary statistics
  -	Visualize data

---

## What types of variables do we have in the table?

* How do we get the column/variable names?
* How do we know the data type for each column?
* Which columns in `metadata` should be								
	-	Continuous?
	-	Categorical?

---

## Visualizing raw data
*	Homework asked you to print out the first 5 lines of a data table
* There ares everal ways to do this...


```r
datatable[c(1,2,3,4,5),]    # explicit method	
datatable[1:5,]             # bracket method
head(datatable, n=5)				# first N lines
tail(datatable, n=5)				# last N lines
```

---

## Summary statistics

What types of data structures do these output?  


```r
summary(metadata)			# how do we get a summary of the overall metadata table?
summary(metadata$Weight)	# how do we get a summary of the weights?
median(metadata$Weight)		# median - what is a median?
w.summary <- summary(metadata$Weight)
w.summary["Median"]

sd(metadata$Weight)			# standard deviation
var(metadata$Weight)		# variance
min(metadata$Weight)		# minimum weight
max(metadata$Weight)		# maximum weight
quantile(metadata$Weight)	# weight distribution by quantiles							
quantile(metadata$Weight, probs=seq(0,1,0.1))	# weight distribution by deciles
```

---

## Let's cross reference columns


```r
aggregate(metadata$Weight, by=list(metadata$Sex), mean)
aggregate(Weight~Sex, data=metadata, mean)	#Notice the difference in output

aggregate(metadata$Weight, by=list(metadata$Sex, metadata$SP), mean)
aggregate(Weight~Sex+SP, data=metadata, mean)

aggregate(Weight~Sex+SP, data=metadata, summary)

w.sex_sp <- aggregate(Weight~Sex+SP, data=metadata, mean)	# what type of variable is w.sex_sp?
```

## Data visualization

* This is a huge area of explorataion
* R is tremendously powerful for generating plots and data visualizaiton tools
* Can generally tell someone used MS Excel by how bad the plots look
* Can certainly generate crap in R, but upside is greater
* Numerous packages available, but we will focus on base package until the end of the semester:
  - Lattice
  - ggplot2
  - rgl

---

## Histograms

* Good for summarizing continuous data where you want to break it into discrete classes
* What do these two sets of commands do?


```r
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))  # make two plotting windows
hist(metadata$Weight[metadata$Sex == "F"])
hist(metadata$Weight[metadata$Sex == "M"])
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))  # return to one plotting window

par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
hist(metadata$Weight[metadata$Sex == "F"], breaks = 10, ylim = c(0, 20), xlim = c(0, 
    30))
hist(metadata$Weight[metadata$Sex == "M"], breaks = 10, ylim = c(0, 20), xlim = c(0, 
    30), add = T)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

---

## Merging plots with `add=T`


```r
hist(metadata$Weight[metadata$Sex == "F"], breaks = 10, ylim = c(0, 20), xlim = c(0, 
    30), col = "pink")
hist(metadata$Weight[metadata$Sex == "M"], breaks = 10, col = "blue", add = T)
```

---

## Universal options

* Axis labels


```r
hist(metadata$Weight, xlab="Weights of Peromyscus spp.")
```

* Plot title


```r
hist(metadata$Weight, main="Distribution of Peromyscus spp. weights")
```

* Putting it together


```r
hist(metadata$Weight, main = "Distribution of Peromyscus spp. weights", xlab = "Weights of Peromyscus spp.")
box()
```

---

## What is the output from `hist`?


```r
m.hist <- hist(metadata$Weight[metadata$Sex == "F"], breaks = 10, ylim = c(0, 
    20), xlim = c(0, 30), col = "pink")
f.hist <- hist(metadata$Weight[metadata$Sex == "M"], breaks = 10, col = "blue", 
    add = T)
```

## For Thursday
* Start working on new assignment that will be posted this weekend
* Assignment due Friday
* Read ***Introduction to Statistics with R*** (Chapters 1 and 2)
